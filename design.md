# Design Document: Virtual Try-On System

## Overview

The Virtual Try-On System is a personalized shopping enhancement that allows Amazon customers to visualize products on their own body or face before purchasing. The system integrates directly into the existing Amazon product page flow, using securely uploaded user profile images (full body and face photos) to generate realistic product previews. The architecture supports clothing, shoes, accessories, and cosmetics across multiple product categories, with optional runway-style animations to show products in motion.

The system is designed as a modular, scalable service that processes try-on requests in real-time, leveraging existing product images without requiring additional assets from sellers. Privacy and security are core design principles, with encrypted storage, explicit user consent, and restricted data usage.

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

### Property 1: Image validation consistency
*For any* uploaded image, the validation function should accept the image if and only if it meets all minimum quality requirements (format, dimensions, file size)
**Validates: Requirements 1.3**

### Property 2: Encryption enforcement
*For any* stored profile image, the storage system should return an encrypted version and reject any unauthorized access attempts that are not part of try-on operations
**Validates: Requirements 1.4**

### Property 3: Try-on option availability for compatible products
*For any* product of type clothing, shoes, accessories, or cosmetics, the product page rendering should include a try-on option element

*For any* completed animation, the UI should provide both replay and return-to-static-preview controls
**Validates: Requirements 4.4**

### Property 11: Animation render time
*For any* animation generation request, the rendering time should be less than or equal to five seconds
**Validates: Requirements 4.5**

### Property 12: In-page result display
*For any* try-on activation, the results should be displayed on the current product page without triggering navigation to a different URL
**Validates: Requirements 5.1**

### Property 13: Functionality preservation during try-on
*For any* product page with active try-on results, all standard product page functions (add to cart, purchase, reviews) should remain accessible and functional
**Validates: Requirements 5.2**

### Property 14: Variant switching updates preview
*For any* product with multiple variants, switching from variant A to variant B should update the try-on preview to display variant B
**Validates: Requirements 5.3**

*For any* two identical try-on requests (same user, product, variant), the second request should return a cached result without regenerating the preview
**Validates: Requirements 8.4**

### Property 25: Error isolation
*For any* system error during a try-on request, the error should be logged and that specific request should fail without affecting concurrent requests from other users
**Validates: Requirements 8.5**

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors

**Image Upload Failures:**
- Invalid format: Display clear message indicating supported formats (JPEG, PNG)
- File too large: Display message with maximum file size limit
- Quality too low: Display message with minimum resolution requirements
- Network timeout: Provide retry option with exponential backoff

**Try-On Rendering Failures:**
- Missing profile images: Display prompt to upload images with direct link to profile settings
- Product incompatibility: Hide try-on option and show standard product images only
- Render timeout: Display loading indicator, then error message with retry option after 10 seconds
- Network errors: Cache last successful result and display with "using cached preview" indicator

### Server-Side Errors

**Service Failures:**
- Profile Service unavailable: Return 503 with retry-after header, disable try-on temporarily
- Product Service unavailable: Fall back to basic product display without try-on
- Renderer Service unavailable: Queue requests for retry, return cached results if available
- Storage failures: Log error, notify operations team, return graceful error to user

**Data Validation Errors:**
- Malformed requests: Return 400 with specific validation error details
- Unauthorized access: Return 403 and log security event
- Missing required data: Return 422 with list of missing fields
- Invalid product ID: Return 404 and suggest similar products

**Performance Degradation:**
- High load: Implement request throttling per user (max 10 requests per minute)
- Slow rendering: Return lower quality preview with option to request high quality
- Cache misses: Prioritize requests based on user tier and request age
- Resource exhaustion: Reject new requests with 503 until capacity available

### Error Recovery Strategies

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If try-on fails, always allow user to continue shopping with standard product images
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures (network, timeouts)
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable try-on feature if error rate exceeds 20% over 5 minutes
4. **Fallback Content**: Display cached previews or similar product try-ons when real-time rendering fails
5. **User Communication**: Provide clear, actionable error messages without exposing technical details

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Unit tests will verify specific examples, edge cases, and component integration:

**Profile Service Tests:**
- Valid image upload with consent succeeds
- Image upload without consent is rejected
- Image deletion removes all references
- Encrypted storage is used for all images
- Invalid image formats are rejected

**Product Service Tests:**
- Product type detection for known categories
- Image selection prioritizes front-facing product images
- Incompatible products are correctly identified
- Product metadata retrieval handles missing data

**Try-On Renderer Tests:**
- Overlay generation produces valid image URLs
- Animation generation creates video/GIF output
- Error handling when user images are missing
- Cache hit returns same result for identical requests

**API Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end flow from product page to preview display
- Variant switching updates preview correctly
- Error responses include retry options
- Authentication and authorization checks

### Property-Based Testing

Property-based tests will verify universal properties across all inputs using a PBT library appropriate for the implementation language (e.g., fast-check for TypeScript/JavaScript, Hypothesis for Python, QuickCheck for Haskell).

**Configuration:**
- Each property test should run a minimum of 100 iterations
- Each test must be tagged with a comment referencing the specific correctness property from this design document
- Tag format: `// Feature: virtual-try-on, Property {number}: {property_text}`

**Test Generators:**
- Random user profiles with varying image dimensions and formats
- Random products across all supported categories
- Random color variants for cosmetic products
- Random network conditions (latency, timeouts, failures)
- Random concurrent user loads

**Property Test Coverage:**
- All 25 correctness properties listed above must be implemented as property-based tests
- Each correctness property maps to exactly one property-based test
- Tests should generate diverse inputs to explore edge cases automatically
- Failed tests should provide minimal counterexamples for debugging

**Example Property Test Structure:**
```typescript
// Feature: virtual-try-on, Property 1: Image validation consistency
test('image validation accepts valid images and rejects invalid ones', () => {
  forAll(imageGenerator(), (image) => {
    const result = validateImage(image);
    const meetsRequirements = checkQualityRequirements(image);
    return result.isValid === meetsRequirements;
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

- Load testing: Verify system handles 10,000 concurrent users per region
- Stress testing: Identify breaking points and degradation patterns
- Render time testing: Confirm 95% of requests complete within SLA (3s for try-on, 5s for animation)
- Cache effectiveness: Measure cache hit rates and performance improvements

### Security Testing

- Penetration testing: Attempt unauthorized access to profile images
- Encryption validation: Verify all stored images are encrypted at rest
- Access control testing: Confirm images only accessible for try-on operations
- Data deletion testing: Verify complete removal within 24 hours
